## My process

-   Build the HTML with semantic markup.
-   Add CSS for styling and responsiveness.
-   Test the layout for browser inconsistencies.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   Reset CSS
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

- Applying rules to ``<body>`` that  prevent the display of scrollbars, since all elements had to fit in the viewport.
```
body {
    overflow: hidden;
    // ...
}
```
    
- Using SVG as a background image, resizing and stretching it to match the design.
```
body {
    background-image: url("./../images/bg-desktop.svg");
    background-size: 92vw 100vh;
    background-position: left top;
    background-color: var(--main-bg-color);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    -apple-background-size: 100% auto;
    background-attachment: fixed;
    // ...
}
```
    
### Continued development

- Get a better understanding of SVG.
