### What I learned

How to use SVG background.
```
body {
    color: white;
    font-size: 16px;
    padding: 1rem;
    background-color: var(--main-bg-color);
    font-family: sans-serif;
    background-image: url('./images/bg-mobile.svg#svgView(preserveAspectRatio(none))');
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    margin: 0;
    min-height: 100vh;
    background-position: top center;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: 100% 38%;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm still not comfortable with using SVG elements.

### Useful resources
